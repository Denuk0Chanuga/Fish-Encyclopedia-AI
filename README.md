# Fish Encyclopedia AI

This is a Fish Encyclopedia web application that allows users to upload fish details, such as their scientific names and images. The system verifies fish details, stores the information in a Google Sheet, and uses an AI model (like ChatGPT) to generate descriptions in a Google Doc. This project uses a React-based frontend and a Python Flask backend.

## Features

1. **React Frontend**: 
   - User interface for uploading fish details (scientific names, photos).
   - Fetch API to communicate with the Flask backend.
  
2. **Flask Backend**: 
   - Receives fish data from the frontend.
   - Validates and stores fish data in Google Sheets.
   - Uses AI (like ChatGPT) to generate fish descriptions and stores them in a Google Doc.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - React
  - HTML/CSS
  - JavaScript

- **Backend**:
  - Flask
  - Google Sheets API
  - Google Docs API
  - OpenAI API for generating fish descriptions

- **Other**:
  - Python
  - Node.js
  - Google Cloud (for API services)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Node.js**: Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **Install Python**: Make sure Python 3.x is installed.
3. **Google Cloud Account**: Set up a Google Cloud project and enable Google Sheets and Google Docs APIs.
4. **API Keys**:
   - A `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE` for accessing Google services.
   - A `SPREADSHEET_ID` for the target Google Sheet.

### Setup Instructions

#### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd fish-encyclopedia-interface

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
´´´

3. Start the React development server:
```bash
npm start
´´´

Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd fish-encyclopedia-backend
´´´

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
´´´

3. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
´´´

4. Run the Flask app:
```bash
python app.py
´´´

5. The Flask app should now be running on http://localhost:5000.



Environment Variables

Ensure that the following environment variables are set before running the backend:

SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE: Path to your Google service account file.

SPREADSHEET_ID: ID of your Google Sheet.


You can set these variables in your terminal:

export SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE=path_to_service_account_file.json
export SPREADSHEET_ID=your_spreadsheet_id

API Endpoints

GET /api/fish: Fetch fish details from the database.

POST /api/fish: Add new fish data (scientific name, photo).

PUT /api/fish: Update fish information.


Deployment

Frontend

To build the React app for production:

npm run build

Backend

Ensure that your Flask app is set to run in production mode by setting:

export FLASK_ENV=production

You can then deploy it using a WSGI server such as gunicorn.

gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app

Future Enhancements

Implement authentication and authorization for fish uploads.

Improve AI-generated fish descriptions with more specific data.

Add more details to the fish encyclopedia like habitat, diet, and size.
